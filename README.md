# Freeport Robot Drilling

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for a robotic drilling system inspired by industrial applications, such as those used in mining operations (e.g., Freeport-McMoRan style environments). The project focuses on automating drilling processes using robotics, computer vision, and control systems to improve efficiency, safety, and precision in harsh environments like underground or open-pit mining.

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.8+** (with pip and virtualenv)
- **ROS Noetic** (or ROS2 Humble for newer setups) – for robotics simulation and control.
- **Gazebo Simulator** (version 11+)
- **Dependencies**: NumPy, OpenCV, SciPy, and ROS packages like `moveit`, `navigation`, `perception_pcl`.
- **Hardware** (optional): Compatible robot arm (e.g., UR5 or custom setup) with drilling end-effector.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/dark0sint/freeport-robot-drilling.git
   cd freeport-robot-drilling
   ```

2. **Set Up Virtual Environment** (for Python components):
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **ROS Workspace Setup**:
   - Source your ROS installation: `source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash`
   - Build the workspace: `catkin_make` (if using catkin) or `colcon build` (for ROS2).
   - Source the workspace: `source devel/setup.bash`

4. **Install Additional ROS Packages**:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ros-noetic-moveit ros-noetic-gazebo-ros-pkgs ros-noetic-pcl-ros
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Simulation

1. Launch Gazebo with the drilling environment:
   ```
   roslaunch freeport_drilling gazebo.launch
   ```

2. Start the robot control node:
   ```
   rosrun freeport_drilling drilling_controller.py
   ```

3. For autonomous drilling:
   - Use RViz to visualize: `rosrun rviz rviz`
   - Publish goals via topics (e.g., `/drill_goal` for target coordinates).

Example command for a simple drilling sequence:
```
rostopic pub /drill_start std_msgs/Empty "{}"
```

### Hardware Integration

- Connect your robot hardware via ROS drivers (e.g., Universal Robots driver for UR series).
- Calibrate the drilling tool using the provided calibration script: `python calibrate_drill.py`.
- Ensure safety interlocks are active during real-world tests.
